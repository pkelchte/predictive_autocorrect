# Predict how movie characters would finish your sentences
Tested on latest Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux.

This tool sets up a window with two text fields: one you can type in, 
and one that the computer uses to suggest words you would want to type next.

Those words are in this case derived from TV Series dialogue.
I chose as example Curb Your Enthusiasm, Season 6. 

If I would type

```
The
```
the algorithm suggests
> party point new

and if I would follow up and continue
```
The party
```
I get
> was The Where's

```
The party was
```
> last yesterday tonight


In short: you can write whatever you like, and get reminded of how your favorite characters would finish your sentences. In the example above, the algorithm was probably thinking of this episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wubgGq9Mio4

What words would Shakespeare's predictive autocorrect suggest, and could you be a better writer if you had his pen?
